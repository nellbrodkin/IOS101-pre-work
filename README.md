## App Brainstorming

My favorite applications and some of their features:
- iMessages
  - Searching through all conversations
  - Viewing attachments sent within a message conversation
- Apple Music
  - Collecting songs in playlists
  - Displaying lyrics in real time with the music
- Notes
  - Oranizing notes in folders
  - Draw in notes
 
My own app idea:
- TODO list app
  - Create a list of TODO items
  - Mark tasks as completed
  - Add deadlines, dates, priorities, etc.
  - Color code list items
  - Create seperate lists
  - Move list item deadlines
  - Create a calendar view
    - stretch: sync with calendar
